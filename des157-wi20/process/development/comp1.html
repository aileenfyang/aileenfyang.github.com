  <p>When given more information, I would like to make this a smooth, horizontal scroll website. The first landing page is underwater themed because many people forget that the internet requires many cables that run under the ocean to connect us all. I want to put more detail so people can see that later on. The first couple of pages would changed based on the input that people put, but otherwise most of it should be the same to educate the audience about the physical effects of their internet usage. </p>
