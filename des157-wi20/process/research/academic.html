    <h1>Academic Research</h1>
    <p>
      In my research, I found that Google searches and basically everything digital has a large carbon footprint. For example, a Google search emits around 0.2 grams of carbon dioxide. 1.3 trillion Google searches occur every year, and the number keeps growing as hundreds of thousands of people gain access to the Internet and digital products every year. For just one person, using Google for a month releases the same amount of carbon dioxide as driving a car for one mile. The global information and communication technology (ICT) industry emits the same amount of greenhouse gases as the aviation industry a year. This comes in the form of servers containing and storing all our information, wires running under the ocean connecting us to one another, and more. However, the rhetoric and language used to talk about the ICT industry imply quite the opposite. With words like “instantaneous” and “cloud,” it is no wonder that people get the idea that there are no physical consequences to their digital usage. The branding of the ICT industry appeals to people’s imagination that their data gets sent through the sky, another universe, and magically appears when needed. The reality is that servers are holding the information, requiring massive quantities of water to cool the facilities, using tons of coal and metal, and even changing the ecosystem around them. <br><br>It is comforting to know that technology companies are starting to look for greener options. By putting servers in places with a naturally colder environment, they can reduce the energy and water used to cool the facilities. They have started powering their plants with cleaner energy, like wind power. Part of it is a response to the backlash and consumers holding them responsible for their actions. But another part is based on the financial benefits of switching to cleaner energy. It saves the company money as well. As Ingrid Burrington says, if the companies were switching to clean energy purely for social good and truly altruistic reasons, they would be powering full cities with clean energy. They have enough money to power a lot of the word with clean energy and point the world to a more sustainable path, but they are not. They are doing just enough to cut back some of the operating costs and obtain good PR and press, but nothing more. However, it is a start. Even beginning to think about the effects of digital access is leading to a promising future. <br><br>In the Medium post by We Don’t Have Much Time, they list a couple of things that everyone who has a digital footprint can do to help reduce their carbon emissions. For example, people can delete emails that they won’t use forever, delete duplicate photos that are synced in the cloud, or even use a phone for simple google searches as it requires less energy than a laptop or computer. Change needs to take place from everyone – the individual all the way up to the corporate level. We all need to be held accountable for our future.
